# allpow â€“ the All Powerful London Calculator

This project is written in Python using Streamlit. It is a simple calculator to estimate one's monthly budget (in London by default). I originally made it to help my fellow Malaysian students who are coming to London for the first time organise their finances better. The first problem of coming to a new country far away from home (and also most probably first time renting a property in their life) is to estimate the prices of groceries, transport, rent and the like. This calculator solves that problem.
